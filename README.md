# application_fraud_propensity_model

This data science project consists on detecting fraudsters based on their data from an AXA insurance company dataset.

We use Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest machine learning algorithms to detect fraudsters, and the best evaluation metrics were found in Logistic Regression. Also, we perform Gridsearch to know the best parameters to use in each machine learning algorithms, especially in Logistic Regression algorithm.

This project was made in collaboration with the Girafe Mentorship Program and the description of this project can be found in this link: https://girafe.io/blog

This data science project has two jupyter notebook files, one is the EDA part, where the dataset is cleaned and the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is shown and the other file is the model part, where the three machine learning algorithms are executed, showing their evaluation metrics and the best parameters to use with the Gridsearch functionality.

In order to run this project in Jupyter notebook the libraries for visualisation such as matplotlib, seaborn and the sklearn libraries for Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and GridSearch need to be installed in the Anaconda environment.
